### Activity 5: Shooting Bullets
### Time: 60 min
### üéØ Learning Intention:
Our goal is to make the player shoot a bullet when the spacebar is pressed.
### üëçSuccess Criteria:
*   I can detect when the spacebar is pressed.
*   When the spacebar is pressed, a new "bullet" rectangle appears at the player's position.
*   The bullet moves up the screen until it disappears.
### üí° New Concepts We'll Learn:
*   **Lists:** A type of variable that can hold a collection of items, like a list of all the bullets currently on the screen.
*   **For Loops:** A way to repeat a block of code for each item in a list.
*   **Collision Detection (Simple):** Checking if two shapes are overlapping.
### ü§î What is a List?
Imagine you have a shopping list. You can add items to it (`milk`, `bread`), remove items (`bread`), and check what's on it. A Python `list` is just like that, but for data. We can create an empty list called `bullets` and whenever the player shoots, we add the new bullet's rectangle to this list. This lets us keep track of multiple bullets on the screen at once.
### ü§î What is a For Loop?
A `for` loop is different from the `while` loop we've been using. Our `while running:` loop goes on forever (as long as `running` is true). A `for` loop, on the other hand, goes through a list of items one by one and does something with each of them. For example, `for bullet in bullets:` means "for every single bullet that is currently in our `bullets` list, do the following...". This is perfect for moving and drawing every bullet on the screen.
### üéÆ How We'll Use It in Our Game:
*   **Lists:** We will create an empty list called `bullets = []`. When the player presses the spacebar, we will create a new rectangle for the bullet and `append()` it to our `bullets` list.
*   **For Loops:** We will create a `for` loop that iterates through the `bullets` list. Inside this loop, we will update the Y-coordinate of each bullet to make it move up the screen. We will also draw each bullet.
*   **Collision Detection:** We'll add a simple check. If a bullet's Y-coordinate is less than 0, it means it has gone off the top of the screen, and we can remove it from our list.

### ‚≠ê Challenge Task:
Can you make the bullets wider or taller? Try changing the `bullet_width` and `bullet_height` variables. Also, try making the bullets faster or slower by changing `bullet_speed`. What happens if you make the speed a negative number?
