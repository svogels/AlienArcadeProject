        <h1>Activity 2: Understanding Positioning & Creating the Player</h1>
        <h3>Time: 60 min</h3>
        <div class="lesson-section">
            <h3>üéØ Learning Intention:</h3>
            <p>Our goal is to draw our player on the game window.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="lesson-section">
            <h3>üëçSuccess Criteria:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>I can explain how the coordinate system works in Pygame.</li>
                <li>I can create variables to store the player's position and size.</li>
                <li>I can draw a rectangle on the screen to represent the player.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="lesson-section">
            <h3>üí° New Concepts We'll Learn:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Coordinates (X and Y):</strong> A system for telling the computer exactly where to draw something on the screen.</li>
                <li><strong>RGB Colors:</strong> A way to mix red, green, and blue light to create any color you can imagine.</li>
                <li><strong>Drawing Shapes:</strong> Using Pygame commands to draw simple shapes like rectangles.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="lesson-section">
            <h3>ü§î What are Coordinates?</h3>
            <p>Imagine your screen is a piece of graph paper. To tell a friend where to put a dot, you'd give them two numbers: how many squares to go across, and how many squares to go down. Computers do the same thing! The "across" number is called the <strong>X-coordinate</strong>, and the "down" number is the <strong>Y-coordinate</strong>. In Pygame, the starting point (0, 0) is at the <strong>top-left corner</strong> of the screen.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="lesson-section">
            <h3>ü§î What are RGB Colors?</h3>
            <p>Your computer screen creates colors by mixing different amounts of red, green, and blue light. An RGB value is a set of three numbers, each from 0 to 255, that tells the computer how much of each color to use.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><code>(255, 0, 0)</code> is pure red (all red, no green, no blue).</li>
                <li><code>(0, 255, 0)</code> is pure green.</li>
                <li><code>(0, 0, 255)</code> is pure blue.</li>
                <li><code>(0, 0, 0)</code> is black (no light).</li>
                <li><code>(255, 255, 255)</code> is white (all lights at full intensity).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We'll use these "color codes" to paint our player and other game objects.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="lesson-section">
            <h3>üéÆ How We'll Use It in Our Game:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Coordinates:</strong> We will use X and Y variables to control the player's position. By changing these variables, we will be able to move our player around the screen in the next activity.</li>
                <li><strong>RGB Colors:</strong> We will define a few color variables using RGB tuples to make our code more readable. For example, we'll create a <code>WHITE</code> color for our player.</li>
                <li><strong>Drawing Shapes:</strong> We will use the <code>pygame.draw.rect()</code> function to draw the player on the screen. This function needs to know <em>where</em> to draw (the screen), <em>what color</em> to use, and <em>the position and size</em> of the rectangle.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

            <h3>‚úçÔ∏è Let's Code: Step-by-Step</h3>
            <pre><code class="language-python"># Let's start with the code from our last activity.
import pygame
pygame.init()

# Screen dimensions
screen_width = 800
screen_height = 600
screen = pygame.display.set_mode((screen_width, screen_height))
pygame.display.set_caption("Alien Arcade")

# NEW: Let's define some colors using RGB values.
# This makes it easy to reuse colors without memorizing the numbers.
BLACK = (0, 0, 0)
WHITE = (255, 255, 255)

# NEW: Player properties. We'll create variables for our player's size and position.
# This keeps all the player's information organized.
player_width = 50
player_height = 50
# We want to start the player at the bottom-center of the screen.
# The X position is the screen's width divided by 2.
# The Y position is the screen's height minus the player's height.
player_x = (screen_width / 2) - (player_width / 2)
player_y = screen_height - player_height - 10 # 10 pixels from the bottom

# Game loop
running = True
while running:
    for event in pygame.event.get():
        if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
            running = False

    # NEW: Drawing goes inside the game loop.
    # First, we fill the screen with a background color.
    # If we don't do this, we'll see a "trail" of the player as it moves.
    screen.fill(BLACK)

    # NEW: Now, let's draw the player.
    # We use pygame.draw.rect(). It needs:
    # 1. The surface to draw on (our 'screen').
    # 2. The color (we defined 'WHITE').
    # 3. A Rect object, which is a tuple of (x, y, width, height).
    pygame.draw.rect(screen, WHITE, (player_x, player_y, player_width, player_height))

    # NEW: After drawing everything, we need to update the display.
    # pygame.display.update() tells Pygame to show the new frame.
    pygame.display.update()

pygame.quit()

            <p>Can you change the player's starting position? Try making it start in the top-left corner. What about the bottom-right corner? Also, try changing the player's color. Create a new <code>BLUE</code> color variable and use it to draw the player.</p>
