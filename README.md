# Alien Arcade Game Project

This project is a series of 12 scaffolded lesson activities designed for Year 10 Computer Technology students who are complete beginners to programming. The goal is to guide students through building a simple "Player vs. Alien" arcade game using Python and the Pygame library.

Each lesson is self-contained in its own folder and includes:
- `lesson.html`: An interactive lesson file with explanations, activities, and step-by-step coding instructions.
- `game_activity_XX.py`: The Python source code for that specific stage of the game.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

Before you begin, you need to set up your development environment.

### 1. Install Python

If you don't have Python installed, download and install the latest version from the official Python website.
- Go to [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- Download the installer for your operating system.
- **Important for Windows users:** During installation, make sure to check the box that says **"Add Python to PATH"**.

### 2. Install Pygame

Pygame is the library we will use to create our game. You can install it using Python's package manager, `pip`.

1.  Open a terminal or command prompt.
    -   On Windows, you can search for `cmd` or `PowerShell`.
    -   On macOS, you can open the `Terminal` app.
2.  Type the following command and press Enter:

    ```bash
    pip install pygame
    ```

    This will download and install the Pygame library, making it available for your Python projects.

### 3. Using the Lesson Files

-   Navigate to the folder for the lesson you are working on (e.g., `01_FirstWindow_GameLoop`).
-   Open the `lesson.html` file in a web browser to read the instructions and complete the interactive activities.
-   Open the `game_activity_XX.py` file in Visual Studio Code to write your code.
-   To run your game, open a terminal inside Visual Studio Code (`Terminal > New Terminal`) and run the command:

    ```bash
    python game_activity_XX.py
    ```
    (Replace `XX` with the current activity number).
