### Activity 6: Incorporating Sounds
### Time: 60 min
### üéØ Learning Intention:
Our goal is to add sound effects to our game.
### üëçSuccess Criteria:
*   I can load a sound file into my program.
*   I can play a sound effect when the player shoots a bullet.
*   I can play a different sound effect when a bullet hits the alien.
### üí° New Concepts We'll Learn:
*   **The Pygame Mixer:** A special part of the Pygame library designed for loading and playing sounds and music.
*   **Loading Assets:** Bringing external files, like sounds or images, into our game.
### ü§î What is the Pygame Mixer?
The Pygame Mixer is like the sound system for our game. Just like we had to `pygame.init()` to start the main library, we also need to initialize the mixer. Once it's running, we can use it to load sound files (like `.wav` or `.mp3` files) from our computer and store them in variables. Then, whenever we want to play a sound, we just tell the variable to `.play()`.
### ü§î What are Assets?
Assets are all the extra files that make a game come to life: images for the player and enemies, sound effects for actions, and background music. These are created outside of the code and then loaded into the game. For this lesson, you will need to find or create two sound files: one for shooting (`laser.wav`) and one for an explosion (`explosion.wav`). **Important:** These files must be in the same folder as your Python script for the code to find them!
### üéÆ How We'll Use It in Our Game:
*   **The Pygame Mixer:** We will use `pygame.mixer.init()` at the start of our program. Then, we'll load our sound files using `pygame.mixer.Sound()`.
*   **Loading Assets:** We will create two new variables, `shoot_sound` and `explosion_sound`, to hold our loaded sound files.
*   **Playing Sounds:** When the player presses the spacebar, right after we create a bullet, we will add the line `shoot_sound.play()`. When we detect a collision between a bullet and the alien, we will add `explosion_sound.play()`.

# Make sure you have 'laser.wav' and 'explosion.wav' in the same folder!
# If you don't have these files, the program will crash.
# You can find free .wav files online.
try:
    shoot_sound = pygame.mixer.Sound('laser.wav')

# --- Game Variables ---
# (Previous code for colors, player, alien, and bullets goes here)

# NEW: We need a Rect object for the alien to use Pygame's collision detection.
alien_rect = pygame.Rect(alien_x, alien_y, alien_width, alien_height)

    # Move and manage bullets
    for bullet in bullets[:]:
        bullet.y -= bullet_speed
        if bullet.y < 0:
            bullets.remove(bullet)
        
        # NEW: Collision Detection
        # colliderect() is a handy function that checks if two rectangles are overlapping.
        if bullet.colliderect(alien_rect):
            # If they collide, play the explosion sound.
            explosion_sound.play()
            # Remove the bullet that hit.
            bullets.remove(bullet)
            # Respawn the alien at a new random horizontal position.
            alien_x = random.randint(0, screen_width - alien_width)
            alien_y = 50 # Reset to the top

    # Drawing

    # ... (code for drawing player)
    # Draw the alien using its Rect
    pygame.draw.rect(screen, GREEN, alien_rect)
    # ... (code for drawing bullets)
    
    pygame.display.update()

### ‚≠ê Challenge Task:
Can you add background music? Find a longer music file (like an `.mp3`) and load it using `pygame.mixer.music.load('music.mp3')`. Then, use `pygame.mixer.music.play(-1)` before the game loop starts to play it on a loop. The `-1` tells it to loop forever. You can also adjust the volume of the sound effects using `shoot_sound.set_volume(0.5)` to make them quieter (0.0 is silent, 1.0 is full volume).
