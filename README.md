# Alien Arcade Game Project

Welcome to the Alien Arcade game project!

This project is a series of 12 scaffolded lesson activities designed for Year 9 Computer Technology students who are complete beginners to coding. 

Over the course of these activities, you will learn the fundamentals of programming by building a simple "Player vs. Alien" arcade game using Python and the Pygame library.

## Project Goals

*   To introduce fundamental programming concepts like variables, loops, functions, and conditional statements.
*   To provide a hands-on, engaging project that makes learning to code fun.
*   To guide you through the process of game development, from creating a game window to implementing gameplay mechanics like player movement, shooting, and scoring.
*   To build a portfolio of your work that demonstrates your growing skills.

## Structure

The project is divided into a series of activities, each contained in its own folder. Each folder includes:

*   `lesson.md`: A markdown file with the learning intention, success criteria, explanation of new concepts, and step-by-step instructions.
*   `game_activity_XX.py`: A Python file with the code for that activity.

Let's get started!
