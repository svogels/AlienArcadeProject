        <h1>Activity 3: Getting the Player to Move</h1>
        <h3>Time: 60 min</h3>
        <div class="lesson-section">
            <h3>üéØ Learning Intention:</h3>
            <p>Our goal is to make the player move left and right using the arrow keys.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="lesson-section">
            <h3>üëçSuccess Criteria:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>I can write code that checks for keyboard presses.</li>
                <li>I can update the player's X-coordinate based on which key is pressed.</li>
                <li>The player on the screen moves when I press the left and right arrow keys.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="lesson-section">
            <h3>üí° New Concepts We'll Learn:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Event Handling (KEYDOWN):</strong> Checking for a specific type of event‚Äîwhen a key on the keyboard is pressed down.</li>
                <li><strong>Conditional Statements (if/elif/else):</strong> Code that allows us to make decisions, like "IF the right arrow key is pressed, THEN move the player to the right."</li>
                <li><strong>Updating Variables:</strong> Changing the value of a variable, like <code>player_x</code>, to move our character.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="lesson-section">
            <h3>ü§î What is Event Handling?</h3>
            <p>Remember our <code>for event in pygame.event.get():</code> loop? It's like a mail carrier checking a mailbox for new letters. So far, we've only looked for one type of letter: the <code>pygame.QUIT</code> letter. But there are many other types! <code>KEYDOWN</code> is an event that happens the moment you press a key. We can check which specific key was pressed (like the left arrow or right arrow) and then make something happen in our game.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="lesson-section">
            <h3>ü§î What are Conditional Statements?</h3>
            <p>Conditional statements are like choosing your own adventure. They let your program make decisions. The simplest is an <code>if</code> statement: "<strong>If</strong> this is true, <strong>then</strong> do that." We can add <code>elif</code> (short for "else if") to check for other conditions, and <code>else</code> to do something if none of the conditions are met.</p>
            <p>Example:</p>
            <pre><code class="language-python">if weather == "rainy":
  print("Bring an umbrella!")
elif weather == "sunny":
  print("Wear sunglasses!")
else:
  print("Have a great day!")
</code></pre>
        </div>
        <div class="lesson-section">
            <h3>üéÆ How We'll Use It in Our Game:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Event Handling:</strong> Inside our main game loop, we'll add a new check inside our event <code>for</code> loop. We'll check <code>if event.type == pygame.KEYDOWN</code>.</li>
                <li><strong>Conditional Statements:</strong> Once we know a key has been pressed, we'll use another <code>if</code> statement to check <em>which</em> key it was. <code>if event.key == pygame.K_LEFT:</code> will check for the left arrow key, and <code>pygame.K_RIGHT</code> for the right arrow key.</li>
                <li><strong>Updating Variables:</strong> Inside our conditional statements, we will change the <code>player_x</code> variable. To move right, we will add to <code>player_x</code>. To move left, we will subtract from it. We'll also create a <code>player_speed</code> variable to control how fast the player moves.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>‚≠ê Challenge Task:</h3>
            <p>Right now, the player can move off the screen! Can you add a new conditional (<code>if</code>) statement to prevent this? After you update <code>player_x</code>, check <code>if player_x < 0</code>. If it is, set <code>player_x = 0</code>. Then, add another check to see if the player has gone too far to the right. The right edge is <code>screen_width - player_width</code>.</p>
