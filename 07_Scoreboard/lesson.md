### Activity 7: Creating a Scoreboard
### Time: 60 min
### üéØ Learning Intention:
Our goal is to display the player's score on the screen and increase it when they hit an alien.
### üëçSuccess Criteria:
*   I can create a variable to keep track of the score.
*   I can render text and display it on the game window.
*   The score increases by one every time a bullet hits the alien.
### üí° New Concepts We'll Learn:
*   **Fonts and Text Rendering:** How to create text objects in Pygame and draw them onto the screen.
*   **Blitting:** The process of drawing one image or surface onto another.
### ü§î What is Text Rendering?
We can't just tell Pygame to "write the score on the screen." We have to go through a few steps. First, we need to create a `Font` object, which is like choosing a font style and size in a word processor. Then, we use that font to `render()` our text. This creates a new, special image (a `Surface`) of our text. It's like creating a rubber stamp of the words "Score: 10".
### ü§î What is Blitting?
"Blit" is a funny-sounding word that just means copying pixels from one place to another. Once we have our "rubber stamp" image of the score, we need to stamp it onto our main `screen`. The `screen.blit()` command does exactly this. It takes the text surface and a position (X and Y coordinates) and draws the text at that location. We have to do this every single frame, because our `screen.fill(BLACK)` call erases everything, including the old score.
### üéÆ How We'll Use It in Our Game:
*   **Score Variable:** We will create a new variable, `score = 0`, at the beginning of our program.
*   **Text Rendering:** We will create a `Font` object using `pygame.font.Font()`. Inside our game loop, we will `render()` the current score into a text surface.
*   **Blitting:** We will use `screen.blit()` to draw the text surface onto our main screen in the top-left corner.
*   **Updating Score:** When a bullet collides with the alien, right after we play the explosion sound, we will add the line `score += 1`.
### ‚úçÔ∏è Let's Code: Step-by-Step
```python
import pygame
import random

# ... (initialization and setup code)

# NEW: Score variable
score = 0
# NEW: Font object. 'None' uses the default Pygame font. 36 is the size.
font = pygame.font.Font(None, 36)

# ... (player, alien, bullet variables)

running = True
while running:
    # ... (event handling code)

    # ... (position update code)

    # Bullet and collision logic
    for bullet in bullets[:]:
        bullet.y -= bullet_speed
        if bullet.y < 0:
            bullets.remove(bullet)
        elif bullet.colliderect(alien_rect):
            explosion_sound.play()
            bullets.remove(bullet)
            # NEW: Increase the score
            score += 1
            alien_x = random.randint(0, screen_width - alien_width)
            alien_y = 50

    # Drawing
    screen.fill(BLACK)
    
    # ... (draw player, alien, bullets)

    # NEW: Render the score text
    # The 'True' is for anti-aliasing (makes the text look smoother).
    # WHITE is the color of the text.
    score_text = font.render(f"Score: {score}", True, WHITE)
    
    # NEW: Blit the score text onto the screen
    # We'll put it at position (10, 10), which is the top-left corner.
    screen.blit(score_text, (10, 10))
    
    pygame.display.update()

pygame.quit()
```

### ‚≠ê Challenge Task:
Can you change the font and size of the score? You can use a specific font file (like `arial.ttf`) by changing the font line to `font = pygame.font.Font('arial.ttf', 48)`. You'll need to have the font file in your project folder. Also, try changing the color of the score text. Create a new `YELLOW` color variable and use it in the `font.render()` function.
